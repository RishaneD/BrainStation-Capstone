## Environment

To set up the same Conda environment used in this project with the same specifications, download the file titled `capstone_environment.yml` and run the following code block:

```
conda env create -f capstone_environment.yml
```

This will create a Conda environment called `capstone` that can be used to run the code contained in the Jupyter Notebooks. 

## Note: Functions

Many of the Jupyter Notebooks in this repo contain functions in the appendix that perform specific tasks in code cells above. Please run these code cells before running the rest of the notebook to avoid any errors.
